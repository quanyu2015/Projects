# My data mining projects
####  QUAN YU, PhD

### 1. Data visualization   
These graphs are generated using _ggplot2_ and _igraph_.

### 2. Allstate Claims Severity 
This project is one Kaggle competition. It predicts the cost of car accidents using a mixture of continuous and categorical variables.

### 3. Coursera project
This machine learning project is from Coursera course [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning). This main purpose of this project is to predict weight lifting styles using accelerometer data.

### 4. Predict diagnosis of breast cancer
My prediction model was developed using MLlib on Spark.
